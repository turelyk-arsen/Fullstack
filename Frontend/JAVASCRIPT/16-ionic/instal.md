Ionic is a popular open-source framework for building mobile applications. It uses web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create native-like mobile applications.

Ionic provides a set of pre-built UI components, such as buttons, forms, and tabs, that are optimized for touch screens and provide a consistent look and feel across different platforms. It also comes with a command-line interface (CLI) tool that streamlines the development process and provides a number of helpful features, such as live reloading and app testing on real devices.

One of the key advantages of using Ionic is that it allows developers to write once and deploy to multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, and the web. This is achieved through a process called hybrid app development, where the code is wrapped in a native container that allows it to access device-specific features, such as the camera and GPS, while still running as a web app.

Ionic is a powerful and flexible framework that is well-suited for building mobile applications of all types and sizes.

---

## ionic --version

This should display the version number of the Ionic CLI that you just installed.

## Once is insalled :

The next step after installing Ionic would be to create a new Ionic project and start building your mobile application. Here are the steps to create a NEW IONIC PROJECT PROJECT:

Step 1: Open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project (create you = flder = directory)

Step 2: Run the following command to create a new Ionic project:

---

## ionic start myApp blank

This will create a new Ionic project named "myApp" using the "blank" template.

Step 3: Navigate to the project directory by running the following command:

---

## cd myApp

Step 4: Run the following command to serve your project in the browser:

---

## ionic serve

This will launch your project in a browser window at http://localhost:8100/. You can make changes to your project and see them live-reload in the browser.

## Ionic supports building mobile applications with Vue, Angular and React

As exemple: Here are some steps to get started with building an Ionic application using Vue:

Step 1: Install Ionic CLI and Vue CLI: To start building your Ionic application with Vue, you'll need to install the Ionic CLI and Vue CLI. You can install them by running the following commands:

---

npm install -g @ionic/cli
npm install -g @vue/cli

---

Step 2: Create a new Ionic app with Vue: Use the Ionic CLI to create a new Ionic app with Vue by running the following command:

---

## ionic start myApp blank --type=vue

This will create a new Ionic app with a blank template and Vue as the framework.

Step 3: Customize your app: Once your app is created, you can start customizing it by adding new pages, components, and functionality. Refer to the Vue documentation and the Ionic documentation for more information on how to build with Vue and Ionic.

Step 4: Test and deploy your app: Use the Ionic CLI to test your app on different platforms and devices by running the following commands:

---

## ionic serve

You can also deploy your app to app stores or as a web app by following the platform-specific deployment instructions.
